/// Application delegate used only for shortcut-confirmation plumbing.
///
/// macOS lets Cmd+Q and Cmd+W tear the app/window down with a single
/// keypress. That's trivially easy to hit by accident while a game is
/// running, so we pop a confirmation dialog — **but only for the
/// keyboard-shortcut path**. Selecting the same command from the menu
/// bar skips the confirmation, on the theory that a deliberate menu
/// click already expresses intent.
///
/// Design:
/// - **Cmd+Q** flows through unchanged to `applicationShouldTerminate(_:)`,
///   which puts up the confirmation sheet. The keyDown monitor only records
///   that the terminate was shortcut-triggered (so a *menu* Quit skips the
///   prompt — the menu invokes the action directly, the monitor never fires).
/// - **Cmd+W** is intercepted *and swallowed* by the keyDown monitor, which
///   then drives the confirmation itself. We do this in the monitor rather than
///   from `NSWindowDelegate.windowShouldClose(_:)` because we must NOT become
///   the window's delegate: SwiftUI owns the `Window` scene's delegate, and
///   stealing it tears the window down on a backgrounded document open
///   (`.b88script` double-clicked while another app is frontmost) → the app
///   quits. The sheet is presented via `beginSheetModal` dispatched async, so
///   there is no nested-runloop reentrancy (the bug that originally pushed this
///   onto the delegate hook).
/// - Closing the main window cascades to the supplementary windows (Debugger)
///   via `NSWindow.willCloseNotification` — a notification, so again no delegate.
